This repository contains my practice work with various machine learning algorithms and techniques for improving model performance. 
The main goal is to implement and compare different approaches in supervised and unsupervised learning.

--Supervised Learning Algorithms Mastered
a. Linear Regression
b. Logistic Regression
c. Decision Trees
d. Random Forests
e. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
f. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
g. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
h. Naive Bayes

--Pipeline Creation
a. Designed and implemented machine learning pipelines using tools such as scikit-learnâ€™s Pipeline and ColumnTransformer for feature engineering.
b. Automated data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps for model's efficiency.

--Model Improvement Techniques
a. Hyperparameter optimization (Grid Search, Randomized Search)
b. Cross-validation strategies to ensure reliable model evaluation
c. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)
d. Regularization methods (L1, L2) to prevent overfitting
e. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
f. Handling class imbalance with resampling techniques
